Problem Statement
You work in a large warehouse 
where products are numbered from 0 to N-1. 
Your task is to identify any products that appear 
twice in the inventory list and report them in ascending order. 
This helps ensure accurate inventory management.

For instance, 
if you have N = 4 products with IDs {0, 1, 3, 2}, and no duplicates exist, 
you report -1. However, if you have N = 5 products with IDs {1, 1, 2, 2, 3}, 
you must report the duplicates in ascending order: 1 2. This ensures your warehouse 
maintains efficient inventory control. The input products must be listed in ascending order.

Now design a program using recursion to solve the given problem statement.
