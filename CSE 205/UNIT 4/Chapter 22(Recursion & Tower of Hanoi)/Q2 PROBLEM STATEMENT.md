# PROBLEM STATEMENT


>During an archaeological expedition, a team discovers the "Disk of Light," an artifact consisting of concentric rings with unique symbols. To unlock its powers, they must perform the "Tower of Wisdom" ritual.

## In this ritual:

 - There are three pedestals: Source (A), Auxiliary (B), and Illuminated (C).
- Disks are stacked on the Source pedestal, with smaller ones on top of larger ones.
- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty pedestal.
