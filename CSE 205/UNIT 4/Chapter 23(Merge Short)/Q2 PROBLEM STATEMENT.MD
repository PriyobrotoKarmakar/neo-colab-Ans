# PROBLEM STATEMENT>
> Raj wants to learn a sequence of integers. His task is to count the frequency of each unique integer in the sequence and then sort them based on their
> frequencies in ascending order. If two integers have the same frequency, sort them in ascending order of their values.
> For this goal, your task is to implement the logic of the merge sort and a recursive function.
- Example 1
- Input:
> nums = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3}
> Output: {3,1,1,2,2,2}
